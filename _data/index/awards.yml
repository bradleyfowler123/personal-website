    detail: In 24 hours, we developed an automated on-street parking management system. The project involved hacking microcontrollers with magnetometers to detect cars. These devices then communicate with each other via Bluetooth low-energy to pass a signal to the internet via a LoRa network. The information is presented in real-time via a web interface to enable real-time detection of on-street parking spaces. We placed second in the competition.
